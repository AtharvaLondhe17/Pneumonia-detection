This project is a Pneumonia Detection System using Chest X-ray images powered by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It employs TensorFlow and Keras for model training. The model is trained to classify X-ray images as 'Pneumonia' or 'Normal' with data augmentation for improved accuracy. The trained model weights are stored in "pneumonia_detection_model.h5" for efficient predictions.
